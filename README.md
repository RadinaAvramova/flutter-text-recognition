# Flutter Text Recognition
Welcome to the Flutter Text Recognition project! This Flutter application demonstrates the use of text recognition capabilities using machine learning models. With this application, users can capture images containing text and extract the text content from them using optical character recognition (OCR) technology.

## Features
1. **Text Detection:** Detects text regions within images captured by the device's camera or selected from the gallery.

2. **Text Extraction:** Extracts text content from detected text regions using OCR technology.

3. **Image Processing:** Provides image processing functionalities such as cropping and enhancing captured images to improve text recognition accuracy.

4. **Real-Time Recognition:** Supports real-time text recognition for live camera feed, enabling users to extract text from scenes in real-time.

5. **Multi-Language Support:** Supports text recognition in multiple languages, allowing users to extract text content from images in different languages.

## Installation
To use the Flutter Text Recognition application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/flutter-text-recognition.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd flutter-text-recognition

3. **Run the Application:** Start the Flutter application using your preferred development environment or the command line:

flutter run

## Usage
1. **Launch the App:** Open the Flutter Text Recognition app on your device.

2. **Capture or Select Image:** Capture an image containing text using the device's camera or select an image from the gallery.

3. **Process Image:** Process the captured image to enhance text recognition accuracy, if desired.

4. **Detect Text:** Detect text regions within the image using the provided text detection functionality.

5. **Extract Text:** Extract text content from the detected text regions using OCR technology.

6. **View Extracted Text:** View the extracted text content on the screen, edit if necessary, and copy or share as needed.

## Customization
1. **OCR Engine Configuration:** Customize the OCR engine settings and parameters to optimize text recognition performance for specific use cases or languages.

2. **User Interface:** Customize the user interface and user experience of the application to match branding requirements or improve usability.

3. **Image Processing Filters:** Implement additional image processing filters or enhancements to further improve text recognition accuracy.
